# Billionaire Status Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing billionaire data to predict their status as either self-made or inherited. Using a dataset containing information like age, net worth, gender, and business sectors, the project applies data preprocessing, clustering, and machine learning techniques to explore wealth distribution and identify key factors influencing billionaire status.

## Project Structure

- **Code**: Scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model training.
- **Dataset**: The dataset containing statistics of billionaires used in this analysis.
- **Report**: A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, results, and insights.
- **Presentation**: A PowerPoint summary of the project, including key findings and visualizations.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Grouped billionaires based on features like age and net worth using KMeans clustering.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implemented Random Forest and Linear Regression models to predict billionaire status, achieving reasonable accuracy.
- **Visualizations**: Generated scatter plots, heatmaps, and line charts to visualize patterns and correlations in the data.

## Installation

To run the project, install the necessary Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Code**: Execute the Python scripts for data analysis and model training.
2. **Review the Report**: Read the detailed project report for methodology and findings.
3. **View the Presentation**: Explore the PowerPoint slides for a visual summary of the project.

## Results

The analysis identified significant factors influencing billionaire status, such as age and business sector. The Random Forest model provided effective predictions of whether a billionaire is self-made or inherited.
